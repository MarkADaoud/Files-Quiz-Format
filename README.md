This program opens two files one for reading and one for writing and checks to see if they both opened correctley. Then the 
program prints a general header for each column in the output file. The program then reads each line of the file and finds the names of 
 tthe indiviuals and their test scores. The program then prints to the output file the names of the indiviuals in last, first and each of their 
 quiz scores on one line with the average at the end assuming that the number of quizzes was 10 and it was a 0 if they did not take it. The program 
 then closes those two files and thn opens the files in the reverse order and reads from the output file and prints that information in the input 
 file essentially swapping the initial input file wih the names and quiz grades with the formatted output file.
